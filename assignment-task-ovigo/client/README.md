**Several Types of Packages Used in this Project**


### Firebase Authentication

Firebase Authentication is a powerful service provided by Google Firebase that offers built-in user management, secure authentication methods, and seamless integration with other Firebase services. In our project, we used Firebase Authentication for user registration, login, and authentication processes. This allowed us to implement user authentication quickly and securely.

To set up Firebase Authentication in your project, follow these steps:

1. Create a Firebase project on the Firebase console.
2. Enable the Authentication service in your project settings.
3. Configure the desired authentication methods, such as email/password, Google Sign-In, or social media authentication providers.
4. Install the Firebase SDK and initialize it in your application.
5. Use the Firebase Authentication APIs to handle user registration, login, and other authentication-related tasks.

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for Token Generation

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is a standard for creating and verifying tokens that represent authenticated users. We used JWT in our project's backend to generate tokens upon successful authentication. These tokens can then be used for authorization and secure communication between the client and server.

The advantages of using JWT include stateless authentication, scalability, and easy integration with various platforms and frameworks.
